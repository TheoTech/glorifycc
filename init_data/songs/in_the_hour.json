        "In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,",
        "Lest by base denial I depart from Thee.",
        "When Thou seest me waver, with a look recall,",

        "With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm,",
        "Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm,",

        "Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary."

        "Should Thy mercy send me sorrow, toil and woe,",
        "Or should pain attend me on my path below,",

        "Grant that I may ever cast my care on Thee."

        "When my last hour cometh, fraught with strife and pain,",
        "When my dust returneth to the dust again,",
        "On Thy truth relying, through that mortal strife,",
        "Jesus, take me, dying, to eternal life."
