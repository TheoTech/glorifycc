        "A mighty fortress is our God,",
        "A bulwark never failing;",
        "Our helper He, amid the flood",
        "Of mortal ills prevailing.",
        "For still our ancient foe",
        "Doth seek to work us woe;",
        "His craft and pow'r are great,",
        "And, armed with cruel hate,",
        "On earth is not his equal."

        "Did we in our own strength confide,",
        "Our striving would be losing;",
        "Were not the right Man on our side,",
        "The Man of God's own choosing.",
        "Dost ask who that may be?",
        "Christ Jesus, it is He;",
        "Lord Sabaoth, His name,",
        "From age to age the same,",
        "And He must win the battle."

        "For lo, his doom is sure,",
        "One little word shall fell him."

        "The Spirit and the gifts are ours",
        "Thro' Him who with us sideth.",

        "The body they may kill:",
        "God's truth abideth still,",
        "His kingdom is forever."
