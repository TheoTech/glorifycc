  p Here are a few fundamental principles:
  ul
    li We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
    li We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
    li We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

  p Glorify.cc respects your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

  h2 Website Visitors
  p Like most website operators, Glorify.cc collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also use Demographics and Interest Reporting, which records age and sex data. To opt out of sharing this information, visit your Google ads settings at https://www.google.com/settings/ads.
  p Glorify.cc's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Glorify.cc's visitors use its website. From time to time, Glorify.cc may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties for advertising purposes as described in the “Cookies” section below. Glorify.cc also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Glorify.cc only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
  h2 Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
  p Certain visitors to Glorify.cc choose to interact with Glorify.cc in ways that require Glorify.cc to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Glorify.cc gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors who sign up for Glorify.cc must provide an email address. Glorify.cc collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Glorify.cc. Glorify.cc does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
  h2 Aggregated Statistics
  p Glorify.cc may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Glorify.cc may monitor the number of monthly active users or the total number of songs exported. Glorify.cc may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Glorify.cc does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
  h2 Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
  p Glorify.cc discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Glorify.cc's behalf or to provide services available at Glorify.cc’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Glorify.cc’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Glorify.cc will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations as described above, Glorify.cc discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Glorify.cc believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Glorify.cc, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Glorify.cc takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
