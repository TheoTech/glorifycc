        h3 What is CC0 and public domain?
        p.
            CC0 (or Creative Commons Zero) is “a license used by the creator/rights holder of a work to change the copyright state of a work, enabling it
            to be used freely by anyone worldwide.” (Source: <a href=https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</a>)
        p This license is critical to giving people permission to use creative works freely as in freedom.
        p Public domain is a label of the state of a work that has fallen out of copyright and into the public domain, and can be used freely by the public.

    #whyCopyrightMatters.helpPageQuestion
        h3 Why does copyright matter?
        p.
            Many worship songs sung in churches today are copyrighted and originate from English-speaking countries. This legally means that copyright
            holders can restrict the usage, display, printing, copying, and translation of these songs in virtually anyway and for virtually any reason.
            Practically, this means churches are required to pay to obtain a license to perform, display, print, translate, distribute and use these songs.
            Each country may have different licensing requirements.

        p.
            We believe many people have no desire to impose this hindrance to worship for the Global, but would love to contribute their songs for the benefit
            of the Global Church to use freely. We believe God has gifted many believers in the Body with musical and lyrical gifts that are intended to bless
            the entire Body and that creating a platform where they can freely share their work and make it freely available to others is the best way to
            facilitate that.

        p.
            Imagine if in churches around the world we were singing music that originated from Asia, the Americas, Africa, Europe, Australia, (and maybe even
            Antarctica!) -- each person singing in their own language, but with one voice glorifying God (cf Romans 15:6). Imagine if churches around the world
            reflect Jesus’ vision in Revelation 7 of a church constituted by people from every language, united in its worship of God and faith in Jesus Christ.
            We believe this is a vision God wants all of us to experience every Sunday and we humbly offer Glorify.cc as a simple step towards making that dream
            a reality.

        p.
            We want to see the Church unleashed from the segregated status quo. We want to see the Church united in worship across language and culture.
            We want to see the Church worshiping together freely.

        p.
            Revelation 7 says that people from every language and every part of the world will be praising God together.
            Glorify.cc helps make that vision a reality.


    #compensation.helpPageQuestion
        h3 What about compensation?
        p.
            We believe Christians who earn their living by writing, performing and sharing songs of worship deserve their wages. However,
            we also believe that the status quo is significantly mis-configured for our times. Furthermore, the professional Christian
            artist cannot exist in many parts of the world where Christianity is restricted, and in times past many great believers
            contributed their music as hymns to be translated and sung by any believer freely.

        p.
            In the present day, we believe professional Christian artists can continue to make their living through the music they create, perform, sell and share.
            We also believe that if they would contribute just one song to the Creative Commons, they could bless the Global Church in ways that would greatly exceed the economic benefits.
            Imagine what would happen if a famous Christian artist contributed their top song to the Creative Commons.
            It would mean that Christians would have the legal freedom to translate that song into any language and use it for
            worship in their language and with their people without any restriction. The artist could continue making a living with all of their other songs.
            But this one small gift could have an outsized impact on worship around the world.

        p.
            We also believe that there is an opportunity here for the long tail of Christian artists who want to be recognized and reward for their work, but cannot
            earn a living only from their musical gifts. Eventually we hope Glorify becomes a place where any believer, any artist and any translator who wants to contribute
            a worship song to the Global Church can do so and be appreciated for their service. We think this will eventually be possible through a mechanism where people can
            give to support the artists whose music they love and use, perhaps similar to a Patreon or Twitch model.
        p.
            At the end of the day our objective is to empower believers around the world to worship together and worship freely in any language
            and to make the singing aspect of worshipping Jesus an integral part of each of our lives. All of our work is meant to support this goal.
