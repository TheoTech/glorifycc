            h1 Support Glorify
            p Glorify.cc is a platform created by TheoTech LLC, inspired by Revelation 7. We want to 1) enable believers from various languages/cultures to worship together in many languages, 2) provide independent Christian songwriters a place to share their worship songs with the body of Christ, and 3) enable translators to use their talents to share song translations and bless others. Do you also want to see the church unleashed to worship in many languages? Support us by signing up for a subscription! By subscribing, you can have your name added to the Supporters page.
            p Your subscription to Glorify enables us to keep the website running and continuously improve features so more people around the world can benefit from the shared worship songs and translations.
            p If you arenâ€™t able to subscribe right now, you can always support us by contributing one of your own songs or translations under the CC0 license, or by sharing Glorify with your friends and church!
